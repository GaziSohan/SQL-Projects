# SQl-projects
Here I store all the SQL projects that I work on within and outside my company

Tables:
We have used 3 tables to write this query -
1. spicemodels_unipart
2. spicemodels_part
3. auth_user

## I have joined the 3 tables to get multiple different column from differnt tables as per query request and report
## requirements are clearly stated in the main query file
